Motivation:

1. Objective: Identify the most efficient and cost-effective methods for diagnosing COVID-19 and other viral and bacterial pneumonias (such as MERS, SARS, and ARDS).
2. Challenges: PCR tests often take around 48 hours to deliver results, which can be inaccurate and expensive, making them inaccessible to many people. Limited availability of tests in some regions leads to untreated cases and potential fatalities.
3. Resource Shortage: The overwhelming number of infected individuals has resulted in medicine shortages in local pharmacies.

Goals:

1. Diagnosis Improvement: Address the issues of medication scarcity and inaccurate diagnoses by some healthcare providers.
2. Cost Reduction: Reduce the substantial national expenditure on diagnostic tests and treatments.
3. Technological Solution: Develop a web application utilizing Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to analyze CT chest scans and chest X-rays, providing immediate and accurate results for suspected cases.
