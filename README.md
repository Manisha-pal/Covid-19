**Overview:**

1. Given the limited availability of COVID-19 test kits in medical facilities, it is crucial to develop and implement an automated detection system as an alternative diagnostic tool for commercial use. Chest X-ray imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnosing COVID-19, and computer vision combined with deep learning techniques can effectively detect the virus from these images.

2. Leveraging the extensive availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in image analysis and classification. In this research, we propose a deep convolutional neural network trained on five open-access datasets, providing binary output (Normal and COVID).

**DATASET:**

1. The proposed model is trained on a combination of two open-source datasets: the COVID-19 Image Data Collection and Covid-Net. The former includes high-quality chest X-ray images from various medical sources, while the latter has images from infected patients, making it the largest benchmark dataset for COVID-19.

2. The combined dataset, after filtering, contains chest X-ray images categorized into two labels: Covid (Pneumonia)(Positive) and normal (Negative) . It includes images from notable medical databases such as the COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative.

**Motivation:**

1. Objective: Identify the most efficient and cost-effective methods for diagnosing COVID-19 and other viral and bacterial pneumonias (such as MERS, SARS, and ARDS).
2. Challenges: PCR tests often take around 48 hours to deliver results, which can be inaccurate and expensive, making them inaccessible to many people. Limited availability of tests in some regions leads to untreated cases and potential fatalities.
3. Resource Shortage: The overwhelming number of infected individuals has resulted in medicine shortages in local pharmacies.

**Goals:**

1. Diagnosis Improvement: Address the issues of medication scarcity and inaccurate diagnoses by some healthcare providers.
2. Cost Reduction: Reduce the substantial national expenditure on diagnostic tests and treatments.
3. Technological Solution: Develop a web application utilizing Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to analyze CT chest scans and chest X-rays, providing immediate and accurate results for suspected cases.
